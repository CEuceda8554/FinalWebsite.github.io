     <p> In the early history of Honduras, the land was occupied by a variety of indigenous people, the Maya. That was until the Spanish arrived to colonize stimulated by gold in the early 16th century, and the Honduran gold-mining town of Gracias became the capital of Spanish Central America in 1544. However, by 1548, the Spaniards had exhausted the gold and Santiago became the new capital.

<p2> In the 1570â€™s a silver strike in the highlands brought a rush of prospectors to Honduras, which resulted in the rise of an important population center at Tegucigalpa. However, the enduring economic base of Central America was slow to develop in Honduras. It then was hindered by coastal attacks from the pirated and buccaneers endemic to the Caribbean Sea and by a concerted British effort to control the coastal areas of Central America. However, the Spanish Bourbon kings made an effort to recover the Caribbean coastal areas, and their success in the Gulf of Honduras was manifested by 1779.</p2>
